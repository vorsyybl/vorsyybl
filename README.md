<h1>About me:</h2>

<h3>How I got started in data analysis:</h3>

<p>From a young age, I was attracted to scientific research and technology, which in the early 90s was just starting its reign. I studied Psychology at SUNY Plattsburgh from 2007-2012, and worked with databases from 2012 to 2019. At this point, I started expanding on my understanding of computer science through self teaching SQL, Excel, and Python.</p>

<h3>What about data interests me the most:</h3>

It is my belief based on personal experience that only from data can truth be discovered. Forces like bias, current events, and the environment are few examples of many that can muddle reality. We are constantly being bombarded and engaged in digitally controlled, contrived environments with fixed rules defined by external entities. The road to truth stems from data and mathematical analysis of it, which is supported throughout history from millions of years ago to today. 

<h3>My passions related to data analytics:</h3>

As a student of Psychology, a science just over a century old compared to its compatriots like Physics or Chemistry spanning millennia, I am blessed, fortunate, grateful, and lucky to live during the dawn of data science. Psychology will play an important role in writing artificial intelligence that will exist in unison with humans as opposed to the contrary. I hope a career in data analytics will eventually lead me to collaborate on projects that will contribute to a harmony between human and machines.
